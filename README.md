# Junocle
Juno + Monocle: A tool to view the data from the Juno project (likely to be renamed)

## Usage
This tool is still experimental and likely to change, but currently consists of two deployable components:
- a user interface (`ui` directory)
- a GraphQL API (`api-django` directory)

There are more detailed instructions within their respective README files.
