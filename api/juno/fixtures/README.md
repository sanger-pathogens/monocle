# Fixtures

During development, it is useful to load some sample data (fixtures) to see how the UI looks.

The fixture for the `sample` table was generated with reference to:
- available samples for the project (`pf info -t study -i 5903`)
- the [manifests](http://sequencescape.psd.sanger.ac.uk/studies/5903/sample_manifests) for the study
- the submitting institutions as used for the map in [juno-app](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/juno-app)
