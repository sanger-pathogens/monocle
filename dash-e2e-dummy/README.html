         Dummy dashboard container for e2e tests

      <p>
         This exists just so there's something running on port 80 in this container <tt>monocle_dash_1</tt>, until the dashboard is added to the e2e test environment
      </p>
      <p>
         Without this, the e2e tests fail because the <i>nginx</i> proxy settings expect there to be a host of that name on the network.
